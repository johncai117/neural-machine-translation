# Neural Machine Translation
Neural Machine Translation Project for Natural Language Processing

The aim of neural machine translation is to use neural networks to automatically translate a text in a language to another language.

In this project, we aim to obtain a good BLEU score, by implementing an encoder-decoder network with attention. In this project, I explore dot attention, multiplicative attention and additive attention, and find that multiplicative attention gives the best results. The results are reported below.
